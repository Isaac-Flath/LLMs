# LLMs

Goals for this repository:

1. Create a RAG process for querying prompting LLMs with technical questions.  Start with established knowledge via deeplearningbook content, then move to more recent papers.
1. Fine Tune LLMs on technical content to see improvement from general LLMs.
1. Play with code interpreter for implementing stuff from papers.  Likely won't be successful, but should be fun.
1. Look at various approaches to gain understanding and understand practical use:
    - dtypes fp 8/16/b1, quantization, etc.
    - LoRa/ QLoRa
    - Try various models on fasteval
